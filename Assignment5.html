            <h1>Assignment 5</h2>
            <p>This week's assignment took a look at Social Media and communication. The first thing I want to discuss is some of the issues with social media like cyberbullying, online abuse, and more. Altho social media can be fun and games at times, unfortunately, situations arise where people use social media for bad things and even worse behavior. The main term we hear is cyberbullying. Cyberbullying is the use of digital technology to threaten harass and humiliate an individual or group. This can be done in many ways like threats, online racism, intimidation, etc. If its issues arise and a young person under 18 years is the target, the Office of the safety eCommissioner is called to help. The Office works closely with social media partners to remove serious cyberbullying from the internet. During this read, I learned that the Office of the safety eCommissioner tries to help with online abuse and bullying with social media. from what I can tell this exists in Australia for the time being, but companies are sure to be spread across the world to try and stop online abuse.
    
    The second activity I was curious about was VOIP. VOIP is short for voice-over-internet protocol. VOIP is a technology that allows you to make voice calls using a broadband Internet connection instead of a regular phone line. One perk of using VOIP over a normal phone would be the cost. The cost to connect one Voip line to another is free. Using VOIP allows you to move around the house and plug in wherever to make that call. VOIP can also be integrated with apps such as email, web browser, and any other custom application you may have like, Discord, Skype, and Facebook. Some disadvantages of VOIP are as follows, Some VoIP services don't work during power outages, Not all VoIP services connect directly to emergency services through 9-1-1., and VoIP providers do not offer directory assistance/white page listings. Although I didn't know what this was upon reading at first I realized I use this technology all the time in my day-to-day life, via skype, Facebook, and discord. I will keep using this technology and hopefully, it never goes away.
    
    The third topic that caught my eye was Web 2.0. In short Web 2.0 is all websites that emphasize user-generated content. Web 2.0 is also known as the social web. A Web 2.0 website allows users to interact and collaborate with each other through social media. This is different than the first generation of web1.0 websites where people were limited to only viewing content. The term "Web 2.0" was created by Darcy DiNucci in her January 1999 article "Fragmented Future". Darcy believed the Web was "fragmenting" into a future that extended beyond the browser/PC combination it was identified with. Web 2.0 websites invited people to leave comments on pages, or create accounts in which you could participate with others viewing that same article. This encouraged the creation of the like button on websites and other social bookmarking. Altho this made room for cool communication. We quickly realized this is a great avenue to spread hate speech, bullying, and defamation. Overall web 2.0 has some great features like rich user experience and user participation, and mass participation. I can clearly see how apps like Facebook, Snapchat, and more social media apps got to where they are today. After years of information and mass participation companies are able to make extremely custom social media applications for you to enjoy. This allows you to be a part of web 2.0 yourself and keep building the internet in a way.
