       Upon completing all lesson 1 activities there were a few topics that I did not know about. The first
      activity I found interesting was everything to do with backups. Backups are for when and if your
      computer is ever lost, stolen, or damaged. Most backup software works with the cloud. The cloud is a
      web-based storage system on the internet. This makes it so your personal and important files can be
      backed up with services like Gmail and yahoo, so if the data gets ruined on your hard drive you can
      easily re-download it to your system. The cloud also helps with extra storage and accessibility this
      means that you can access the cloud data anywhere that has an internet connection. Some of the most
      popular cloud storage systems are Google Drive, Drop Box, and Megashare. I already use google drive
      on a daily basis and also have purchased extra cloud storage space, in the future I just see myself
      continue using the cloud services because of its usefulness in its ability to upload with my
      computer and download that same file to my phone.

    The next topic that caught my eye was accessibility features. Some of these accessibility features
    include text to speech, speech recognition, closed captions, and much more. Accessibility features
    can help blind or low vision computer users by increasing contrast and cursor size making it easier
    for people with disabilities. Furthermore, I also learned what sticky keys do for the first time,
    sticky keys allow you to use certain keys to put up shortcuts you've previously set up.
    Accessibility features can also help with making shortcuts to get to web pages and programs faster
    than manually pulling them up. I already love using shortcuts and pining certain programs or
    websites to my desktop for future use, and I'm sure in the future I will continue to use
    accessibility settings and many more shortcuts.

    The final activity that I felt I learned something in was the brief paragraph about computer
    programs running slow. There are a few things you can do if this is happening to you. First and
    foremost always run a virus scan to see if there are any malicious programs on your computer eating
    CPU and memory. Another solution is the computer may be running out of disk space, for this, you can
    go into your program files and try removing any unwanted programs clearing up space and making your
    computer much faster. The final thing you can do to try and speed your computer up is using a
    software called Disk Defragmenter. This is a program that runs a scan on your computer letting you
    know what programs are causing issues and that you don't need, you can also set this to run
    automatically every day, week, and or month. In the future I definitely see myself using a disk
    defragmenter to clear up space as I work with a lot of video files that take up tons of space fast
    and can slow down my computer.
