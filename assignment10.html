                <p>This week also went over Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). CSS is a style sheet language used for
                    describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language. CSS is helpful for many
                    reasons for starters it Improves content accessibility, as well as reducing complexity, and more
                    flexibility and control. Basically, every well-known website has a page of CSS-style code telling it
                    how to look. This includes the structure of the header, footer, paragraphs, buttons, and more. This
                    week's lesson has gone over a ton of useful information and if I decided to pursue the coding path
                    this information is going to be very useful.
