            In this week's assignment, the class went over everything to do with images audio, and video elements on a
            website. Computer graphics are images generated with the aid of computers. Computer graphics over the years
            have improved all sorts of different technologies, like digital photography, video games, cellphones,
            computer displays, and more. Some more advanced things you can do with computer graphics are things such as
            rendering, ray tracing, computer animation 3D/2D, modeling, and much more. I personally use computer graphic
            programs like Blender, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, and more. These programs are tricky to learn but
            once you get a hang of the GUI you can create some really cool stuff with these computer graphic programs.
            Some of the pioneers of computer graphics were, Charles Csuri, Donald P. Greenberg, and A. Michael Noll.
            Charles Csuri made history by creating the first computer graphic in 1964. Donald P. Greenberg authored
            hundreds of articles and served as a teacher and mentor to many prominent computer graphic artists. Many of
            his former students moved on to win Academy Awards for technical achievements. Finally, A. Michael Noll was
            one of the first researchers to use a digital computer to make artistic patterns and used random processes
            to create visual art. Overall this week's assignment was great for learning all about computer-generated
            graphics, how to make them, and how to use them. I make alot of computer graphics so it was super cool to
            learn where it all started and who made the first computer graphic.
