        <h1>Accessibility</h1>
        <p>
            This session went over a ton of information about Web accessibility. A huge part of web accessibility is the
            challenge to make the website accessible to people with disabilities. Web content accessibility guidelines
            or WCAG is built around four core principles. The first one is “perceivable” so people can see the content
            or hear it. The second principle is “operable”, this covers the usability of the website by typing or voice.
            The third principle is “understandable”, this makes sure the website is in clear language. Finally, the last
            principle is “robust”, this covers all other assistive technologies that can help with a website. WCAG also
            provides Authoring tool accessibility guidelines or ATAG. This defines the requirements for content
            management systems. Another standard they provide is the “User Agent Accessibility Guidelines” or UAAG. This
            guideline defines the requirements for web browsers and media players. Overall I never really thought about
            this topic but its super cool to learn about how inclusive the internet can be. Next time I design a website
            I can build it with accessibility in mind, making the overall process much more user friendly and inclusive.
