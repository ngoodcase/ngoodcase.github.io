		This week's activities and topics were pretty challenging. This week I learned all about the computer
        language HTML. HTML stands for Hypertext Mark up Language. You can simply create HTML files with
        Notepad. HTML lets users create structured documents with images and other objects, such as
        interactive forms, which may be embedded into the rendered page. This is done through the use of
        tags, some common tags in HTML are (P),(H1),(img),(video),(Audio). Every webpage has five main
        elements, HTML, Head, Body, title, and meta,
        each plays an important part when building a webpage. Although there is a lot to learn with
        HTML this is a super useful tool to be able to use. I can for sure see myself creating my
        own personal website for personal use and coding practice.
