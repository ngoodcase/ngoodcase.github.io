		Hi im Nikolai, and this is and example of a javascript script.
        </p>
        <p>
		This week's lesson took a look at everything JavaScript. What is javascript? Javascript is a programming
        language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, next to HTML and CSS. Javascript adds
        programing to our web pages. This allows for an interactive user interface with the website. Javascript lets
        our webpage be dynamic and responsive to user input. Javascript can be implemented with the use of the
        SCRIPT element. Java script can be used for tons of different things within your website, one example
        would having the website display a greeting message once a user enters that website. Another function
        you can create is the Canvas function. This script allows a blank canvas to be pulled up where you can
        draw graphics add images and more. Javascript is used to add interactivity, animations, and dynamic
        content to webpages, this overall allows for a seamless fun user experience. Without even thinking about
        it we use Javascript every day and it allows us to have a user-comfortable experience while being
        productive and helpful. I can definitely see myself learning scripts and seeing what Javascript can do
        for my websites for the future.
