        <h1>SQL</h1>
        <p>
            Upon completing all Assignment 14 activities, I learned a ton of information about SQL. SQL stands for
            Structured Query language. SQL is used as a database programing language originally developed by Donald D.
            chamberlain, and Raymond F. Boyce at IBM in the early 1970s. SQL can be used for data inserts, query data
            and retrieving data, update and delete, and general data access. For example on a site where a product is
            bought, the process of customer buying a product is repeated, SQL makes it so that the whole procedure/ code
            can be reused. Some common commands/terms are Select, From, Join, Where, and Order By. These commands are
            used to navigate through the databases that are created.
        </p>

        <h3> 
            Here are some examples of basic SQL commands
		</h3>
			<h2>
		<ul type="circle">
      <li>SELECT * FROM Customers;</li>
      <li>SELECT CustomerName,City FROM Customers;</li>
      <li>SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country FROM Customers GROUP BY Country;<li>
	  <li>SELECT TOP 3 * FROM Customers;</li>
      <li>UPDATE Customers SET ContactName='Alfred Schmidt', City='Frankfurt' WHERE CustomerID=1;</li>
	  <li>INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, Country) 
	  VALUES ('Cardinal','Tom B. Erichsen','Skagen 21','Stavanger','4006','Norway');</li>
      <li>SELECT CustomerName,City FROM Customers;</li>
	  <li>SELECT * FROM Customers;</li>
      <li>SELECT CustomerName,City FROM Customers;</li>
