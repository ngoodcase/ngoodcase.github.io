		After reading assignment 2 I found a couple topics I did know much about. The first topic I found
        interesting was Opera browser. Opera browser is a free alternative to firefox, google chrome,
		microsoft edge. Opera browser is a noregiew based company who have been around for 25+ years. Opera
        also claims to have over three hundred and fifty million people using its browser. Personally I had
        never heard of the Opera browser until now and it does seem interesting. I can see myself
        potentially using this browser in the future. Upon looking at the openings of the opera I also found
        that they are located all throughout the country and are actively looking for new people to help
        build and improve the browser, super cool.

            The second activity I was curious about was another browser called Brave. Brave browser is another
            alternative to firefox, google chrome, microsoft edge, and our new found Opera browser. One of the
            big main selling points for Brave browser is it claims it is three times faster than browsers like
            google chrome. I also learned that Brave automatically blocks ads from websites in its default mode,
            allowing you to not have to find extra extensions like adblock to add to your browser. They also
            claim to have a built-in VPN into the browser allowing for max anonymity. Some of braves built in
            features are as follows: Invasive ads blocked, cross site trackers are blocked, fingerprints
            blocked, cookies blocked, malware protection, bounce tracking protections, and a built in anonymity
            Tor mode. One final thing to add, if you're into crypto currency there is also a built in wallet to
            trade crypto assets. Brave browser I feel sounds more enticing than some of the other free browsers
            around and it seems to focus on anonymity which is super cool and I can definitely see myself using
            this browser in the future for some of these anonymity perks.

           The third activity that caught my eye was the plugins section. altho ugh i know what plugins are, i
           dont all of the plugins that are available. One plugin I learned about was RealPlayer. RealPlayer is
           a plugin that allows you to turn your web browser into a radio. After installing the plugin you are
           given access to newscasts like National Public Radio, CNN, BBC, CBC, and hundreds of more sites.
           Another plugin I personally remember but don't use any more is Flash Player. This plugin was used
           back in the day to be able to play videos on the web in a fast manner. I personally remember trying
           to watch videos on old school computers and not being able to because the computers did not have
           Flash Player. The last plugin I looked over was Shockwave. This plugin was created by Adobe and was
           one of the very first plugins to add animations for websites. Shockwave was discontinued April 9,
           2019 so you can no longer check it out. In short, Shockwave was a browser based multimedia platform
           for interactive applications and video games. In the future I can definitely see myself using an
           assortment of plugins to help with ease of access to get tasks done faster and to block distractions
           like advertisements.
