		This week's assignment was all about search engines. This week we learned everything from defining
        what a search engine is to how to properly optimize your search engine so you can better surf the
        web. The first thing I found interesting is that when we are “searching the web” we are just
        searching a company's index on the web. Companies like Google make software programs,(Often called
        spiders) to click links on web pages,(Often called spiders) and then repeat this process till there
        are hundreds of millions of web pages that Google is aware of. Google then takes our search terms we
        type into google and chooses what to show us based on questions other people and your history has
        asked. Before this assignment, I never really questioned how the world wide web works but I'm glad I
        know now. The only real way I see myself using this information is if I wanted to create my software
        website by clicking spiders. Those programs alone are cool and I would like to learn how to code
        that eventually to build my database.

         The next topic I learned a bunch about was domain limit searching. Doman limit searching is a
         special type of search that can be performed by google. To do a domain limit search you would type
         in your topic and then add “site” followed by a colon and the type of website you want to appear,
         whether that be government, EDU, ORG, COM, etc. Example (“Laws” site: Gov). This can also be used to
         take away search results. To narrow down search results you would do the same search that you did
         before but add a (-) before the “Site” in the search bar Example (“Laws” -site: Gov). This will now
         list everything but Gov sites helping your search. Before doing this activity I had no idea this was
         possible. I can see myself using this in the future to narrow down my searches.

          The final topic I was surprised by was a tool on the internet called the Wayback Machine. The
          Wayback machine as stated in the activities is a website that allows you to go into the past and
          search up websites and it shows you what that website looked like during that year. This is super
          cool because it allows you to see what the internet was like back in the day. For example, if I
          wanted to look at the New York Times back in 2007 I could with this website. This can be useful for
          multiple different reasons, but I can see myself using this tool to get information about websites
          from a different time periods. During this assignment I used this tool to see what was going on in
          the New York Times on my birthday, super cool.
