		This week's assignment took a deep look at email, sending messages, and programs about email. The
        first thing I feel needs to be talked about is email scams and phishing. To start, phishing is a way
        of trying to get someone's personal information by acting as an official company. For example, you
        get an email that you just won 100$ from amazon but they need you to log in to your Amazon account
        to get your money, they then take your information and often take money from your account. There are
        tons of unique ways people try and pull email scams like this and it's a huge problem and
        responsible for millions stolen every year. I learned that if it's a legit company they will never
        ask for your information. I see emails like this sometimes but have never fallen for one of these
        traps.

         The next email-related program that I was curious about was Mozilla Thunderbird. I learned that
         Mozilla Thunderbird is a free open-source email client that was made by the Mozilla foundation. It
         has features such as a news feed, chat, email encryption, and a personal information manager.
         Thunderbird can also be used across platforms like Linux, Windows, and macOS. Overall this is a
         solid email alternative to the likes of Google, AOL, and yahoo. I can see myself setting up a
         business account using this email service.

         The third topic I was curious about was email spoofing. To quickly go over, email spoofing is the
         creation of an email with a forged sender address. For example, you get an email from your mother
         saying she needs one thousand dollars and to send it right away. This is not only a scam but an
         email spoof. I also learned there are countermeasures that can be implemented. Sender Policy
         Framework (SPF) is a email authenticator designed to detect forged sender addresses. Some of these
         countermeasures are built into apps like Gmail. The way I envision myself using this information is
         just being generally aware these scams are out there and knowing what to avoid when opening an email
         that looks dangerous. Email safety is a big deal in this day and age and a huge part of nearly every
         job you get out in the world, and it's important to know how to stay safe with emails.
