		After completing all lesson six activities there were a few topics that I did not know about that I
        want to talk about. The first topic I want to discuss is IT Certifications. To start off there are a
        ton of certifications you are able to get, some of these being Adobe, Cisco, CompTIA, EC-Council,
        and many more. Having one or more of these certificates will often bump your resume to the top or
        gain you better pay over non-certified competitors. One way I can see myself using this knowledge
        would be for me to look into getting an adobe certification. I can see this being very beneficial to
        display to the future hiring companies as I work in the printing industry and we use Adobe products
        all the time.

         The second topic I want to discuss is the IT career path, there are a few stages. The stages go as
         follows, Trainee, Developer, Analyst, Program Manager, IT Strategist, and Chief Information Officer.
         Trainees focus on gaining knowledge of technology. Developers should be able to show technical
         skills like testing or documenting. Analysts should be able to exercise skills like technical
         design, project implementation, and technical analysis. Program managers work on the business end of
         things and work with people more than technology. In this role, you are expected to change
         management, and lead many projects, and business development. IT Sratiegiest are expected to show
         thought leadership and technical domains, as well as setting IT directions for the business. Finally
         the Chief Information Officer, in this role you are expected to do the overall technical strategies
         of the entire company. You are expected to make strategies and lead large changes. This role talks
         with other businesses to outsource and find vendors. This role usually reports to the CEO of the
         company. This was really useful knowledge and if I ever choose to go down the IT route career-wise i
         feel this class, in general, will give me a leg over the competition.

         The final activity I want to go over is LinkedIn. LinkedIn is a social media application that is
         used to screen and recruit employees. Once you make an account you are given a profile page where
         you are able to post your skills and previous employment, this serves as an online resume. Another
         selling point of LinkedIn is its network-building capabilities. LinkedIn lets you add contacts, also
         known as “connections” allowing companies to easily get endorsements and recommendations. To further
         the connections LinkedIn also allows groups for specific companies and industries allowing you to be
         kept up to date on all news related, as well as find others interested in the same stuff that you
         are. The main attraction to Linked in is its Job Search tool. The Job search tool can find openings
         around the world and allows specific filtering allowing the user to seamlessly apply for the exact
         job you're looking for with ease. Overall I was surprised to learn about LinkedIn job search tool. I
         have a linked in but have barely set it up in the past and I'm glad I'm getting a chance to revisit
         this application so I can do it the right way this time.
