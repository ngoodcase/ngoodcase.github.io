            <h1>Assignment 7</h2>
                <p>This week's assignment took a look at Internet Fundamentals and networking. Working through this
                    lesson I found myself generally familiar with a lot of the topics that were discussed. I previously
                    used to run some small Minecraft servers so a lot of this terminology is familiar but now I get to
                    dive in and learn about the specifics. The first thing I was intrigued by was the Internet Protocol
                    Suite. The Internet Protocol Suite also known as TCP/IP is a set of communications protocols used on
                    the internet. TCP stands for transmission control protocol. TCP provides reliable, ordered, and
                    error-checked delivery of a stream of information between applications running on hosts
                    communicating via an IP network. IP is otherwise known as the internet protocol. The IP has the job
                    of delivering pieces of information from the source host to the destination host solely based on the
                    IP addresses. IP-V4 was the first major version of IP. IPv4 was the first version deployed in
                    January 1983. It is still used to route most Internet traffic today. Lastly, IP-V6 is the most
                    recent version of the Internet Protocol (IP) IPv6 was developed to deal with the problem of IPv4
                    address exhaustion and is intended to replace IPv4. A way I can see myself using this information
                    would be with the use of video game servers. It's essential to learn how the internet protocols work
                    so you can better understand what you are doing on the web.
                    The next topic I want to discuss is DNS, otherwise known as the Domain name system. DNS most simply
                    put is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system made to identify computers reachable through
                    the Internet. The Domain Name System serves as the phone book for the Internet by translating
                    human-friendly computer hostnames into usable IP addresses that people can access through the
                    internet. DNS allows it so different users can simultaneously receive different translations for the
                    same domain name, this provides users faster and more reliable responses on the Internet and is
                    widely used by most major Internet services. DNS makes it possible to that many users can access the
                    same website or page fast and reliable.
                    The last topic I want to talk about is IP Config. IP Config is a command-line interface tool and is
                    also used in the system startup scripts of many operating systems. IP config is used for setting the
                    IP address of a network, and for disabling or enabling an interface. IP config is also commonly used
                    to change the medium access control (MAC) address of an interface. In this process the network
                    interface is first disabled (set down) with the IPconfig command, followed by a MAC change command.
                    I use the command Ip config a lot with setting up computer game servers over my internet and can see
                    myself using command prompt and commands for the rest of my life on the computer. Ipconfig allows
                    you to easily check out your computer's internet information and how you can access it. Overall I
                    see myself using this feature in the future.
