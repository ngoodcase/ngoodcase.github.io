		After completing all Assignment 8 activities there were a lot of activities I was unfamiliar with
        that had to do with cyber security. The first topic of that is encryption. Encryption is the process
        of taking data and encoding it in a form that cannot be read by unauthorized people. There are two
        types of encryption public key and a symmetric key. Symmetric key encryption uses the same key to
        encrypt data as to decrypt data. This is a fast way to encrypt items. Public key encryptions use two
        keys, a public key, and a private key. Public encryption lets you encrypt stuff without the private
        key. In order to decrypt the data, you need the private key. This means the key never has to be
        transferred meaning it's much safer. Public key encryption is much slower but safer than symmetric
        key encryption. It is also possible to combine the two encryptions.

         The next topic I want to talk about is cyber security. One risk is viruses, viruses can send
         instructions to delete everything on your computer, or comply take over the computer itself. One
         person can seat another identity by cracking your account. Although this is bad and all, in a world
         with a perfectly protected internet, the internet would be a very boring place with lots of walls
         and limits, not the internet we know and love today. Another type of attack that can happen is
         called Distributed denial of service (DDoS). This is when a hack overwhelms a website with too many
         requests at once. Hackers can send trillions of requests at a time causing the website to stop
         responding. One last scam to look out for is called a phishing scam. This is when cybercriminals
         send large amounts of spam emails in an attempt to trick people to send sensitive information. The
         email will look like a legitimate company asking you to sign in to your account. Most times if you
         get hacked it is due to human error, so look out and be safe. Some things I'm going to try and
         implement to better my cyber security are to use stronger passwords, make sure the websites are
         legit, update my security software, and generally don't install the software you don't absolutely
         trust.

        One terminology I wasn't aware of was PII, otherwise known as personally identifiable information.
        Personally, identifiable information is any information related to an identifiable person. The
        Internet has made it easier to collect PII, this caused a profitable market for collecting and
        reselling PII. The digital revolution introduced "privacy economics", or the trade of personal data.
        Personal data can also be used to create fake online identities, including fake accounts and
        profiles, this is a form of Identity Fraud. I personally have an experience recently where my
        discord application was hacked and I lost my account because of it. I ended up changing all my
        passwords but I was naive and didn't think it would happen to me. Next time I'm going to put on a
        two-factor authenticator on most of my accounts to try and secure my account more.
